## Overview

Northforge AI receptionists provide 24/7 call answering for contractors. They answer calls instantly, qualify leads based on your criteria, and book appointments directly into your calendar. This reduces missed calls and captures revenue you might otherwise lose.

## AI Receptionist Functionality

Your AI receptionist greets callers, gathers information, and routes based on intent. It uses natural language processing to understand accents, industry jargon, and urgent requests.

### Call Handling Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incoming Call] --> B[AI Greets Caller]
    B --> C{Gather Info?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Ask Questions]
    C -->|No| E[Route Call]
    D --> F{Qualified?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Book Appointment]
    F -->|No| H[Collect Contact]
    G --> I[Send Confirmation]
    H --> I
    E --> J[Transfer or Voicemail]
```

## Lead Qualification Process

Qualify leads by defining scoring rules. The AI asks targeted questions, assigns points, and determines next steps.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Qualification" icon="check">
    Use simple yes/no questions for quick filtering.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Define Criteria" icon="edit-3">
        Set questions like "Are you looking for plumbing services?"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Assign Scores" icon="plus">
        Award points: +10 for "Yes", 0 for "No".
      </Step>
      <Step title="Set Threshold" icon="target">
        Route leads scoring `>20` to booking.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced Qualification" icon="settings">
    Integrate custom scripts for complex logic.

    <CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
    ```javascript
    function scoreLead(answers) {
      let score = 0;
      if (answers.budget > 5000) score += 15;
      if (answers.urgency === 'immediate') score += 20;
      return score >= 25 ? 'hot' : 'warm';
    }
    ```
    ```python
    def score_lead(answers):
        score = 0
        if answers['budget'] > 5000:
            score += 15
        if answers['urgency'] == 'immediate':
            score += 20
        return 'hot' if score >= 25 else 'warm'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Appointment Booking Mechanics

The AI checks your calendar availability in real-time and books slots. Confirmations go via SMS and email.

<Expandable title="Integration Details" default-open="false">
  Connect via webhooks to sync bookings.

  ```javascript
  // Webhook endpoint for new bookings
  app.post('/webhook/northforge', (req, res) => {
    const { customerName, appointmentTime, service } = req.body;
    // Add to your calendar (Google, Outlook, etc.)
    console.log(`Booked: ${customerName} at ${appointmentTime} for ${service}`);
    res.status(200).send('OK');
  });
  ```
