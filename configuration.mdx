## Customize Greetings and Scripts

Tailor your agent's opening lines and response scripts to reflect your brand voice. Use the Script Editor to add service-specific details like `{emergency: true}` for urgent plumbing jobs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Script Editor" icon="edit-3">
    Navigate to `{Dashboard > Agents > Your Agent > Scripts}`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit Greeting" icon="message-circle">
    Replace the default with your custom text.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Script" icon="play">
    Use the Preview tool to simulate calls.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Changes" icon="upload">
    Save and activate to apply live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Include your service area in greetings, like "Serving the greater Seattle area for plumbing emergencies."
</Callout>

Here is a sample greeting script in JSON format:

<CodeGroup tabs="JSON,YAML">
  ```json
  {
    "greeting": "Hello, thanks for calling Northforge Plumbing. This is your AI assistant—how can I help with your plumbing needs today?",
    "services": ["emergency repairs", "installations", "maintenance"],
    "emergency": true
  }
  ```
  ```yaml
  greeting: "Hello, thanks for calling Northforge Plumbing. This is your AI assistant—how can I help with your plumbing needs today?"
  services:
    - emergency repairs
    - installations
    - maintenance
  emergency: true
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Set Up Qualification Criteria

Define questions and scoring rules to qualify leads. Prioritize callers needing `{emergency: true}` or jobs `{value > $500}`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic Rules" icon="check-circle">
    Use these fields to score leads from 0-100.

    | Criterion       | Question Example                  | Score |
    |-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
    | Urgency         | "Is this an emergency?"           | 50   |
    | Job Value       | "What's the estimated cost?"      | 30   |
    | Service Needed  | "What service do you need?"       | 20   |

    High scores (`>70`) trigger immediate callbacks.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced Scoring" icon="trending-up">
    <ParamField path="urgency" param-type="boolean" required="true">
      Set to `true` for 24/7 priority handling.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField query="job_value" param-type="number" required="false">
      Minimum `{500}` for qualified leads.
    </ParamField>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integrate Calendars and Tools

Connect your calendars for real-time booking. Northforge supports Google Calendar, Outlook, and Zapier.

<Expandable title="Supported Integrations" default-open="true">
  - Google Calendar: Sync availability slots.
  - Outlook: Office 365 OAuth flow.
  - Zapier: Connect to CRM like HubSpot.

  Example OAuth config:

  ```json
  {
    "provider": "google",
    "client_id": "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
    "redirect_uri": "https://studio.northforge.ai/oauth/callback"
  }
